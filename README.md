### I do NOT own the creation of ArmorStandEditor. Its orginal creator and credit goes to [RypoFalem](https://github.com/RypoFalem) for making such a good plugin and you should go support them
### And thank you [WolfieHeart for giving support to this plugin](https://github.com/Wolfieheart/ArmorStandEditor). It has been a pretty good help with updating depreciated stuff
I am mainly only updating this plugin as best as i can because a friend uses it and I want to make sure it works as smoothly as possible.
If you want the orginal spigot plugin check here: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/armor-stand-editor-dead.7688/

the basic premise of this is to keep it as similar to the orginal plugin in how it functions and interacts with things while allowing for new features (like the hidden item frames or locking of slots). I looked into [WolfieHeart's version](https://github.com/Wolfieheart/ArmorStandEditor) and it was what inspired me to add some of their changes while keeping it closer to the orginal armorstand editor as possible (minus improvements in example of the itemframe hider, armorstand locked slots, and fixing of depreciated events). I plan to play around with this more in the future too and actually add (more) of my own features when i can get the chance to do so as i have been busy with my main project Havens Edge MC (can be found at [The Website BIG WIP](https://havensedgemc.com), the [Planet Minecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/server/havens-edge-mc/) and our [Discord](https://havensedgemc.com/discord))
