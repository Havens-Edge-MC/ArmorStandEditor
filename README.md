Read the [wiki](https://github.com/RypoFalem/ArmorStandEditor/wiki) for more info.

### I do NOT own the creation of ArmorStandEditor. Its orginal creator and credit goes to [RypoFalem](https://github.com/RypoFalem) for making such a good plugin and you should go support them
I am mainly only updating this plugin as best as i can because a friend uses it and I want to make sure it works as smoothly as possible.
